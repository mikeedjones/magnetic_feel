# magnetic_feel

Though magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the world today, humans have no innate way of sensing them. The intangibility of magnetic fields makes them that much harder to understand. The Magnetic-Feel is an extrasensory toy designed to help students better understand magnetic fields.

The principle of the toy is simple - it's a 2 cm x 2 cm cube which vibrates in the presence of a magnetic field.  As the strength of the vibrations is proportional to the strength of the field,  moving the toy around in a magnetic field allows the student to build up a 3D-mental map of the field, which helps the student understand the 3D-structure of the field.

The housing for the toy was designed in Fusion360 and then 3D printed. The design can be downloaded [here](http://a360.co/2m23xQc).
